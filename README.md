# CMPG323-Overview-30605458

   
  
  This repository is an overview repository for CMPG323 projects. This repository will provide information about all the projects and tasks that I will be doing         throughout the semester. After completion of any project the overview repository will be updated.
  
  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
1. The following repositories will be created and used for each project.
  
  <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Project No</th>
    <th>Project Description</th>
    <th>Project Repository</th>    
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Agile & Scrum</td>
    <td>CMPG 323 Overview-30605458</td>

  2. I am  going to create a single project called <b><em>CMPG323 - 30605458: Kanban Project Plan Guide</em></b> and link all repositories to this one project. This        project will track all the activities of all the other projects and their progress.
     Here is the diagram below

  3. The branching strategy to be used within each project
  <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Project No</th>
    <th>Branching Strategy</th>        
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Trunk-based development</td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Trunk-based development</td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>GitFlow</td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>GitFlow</td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Trunk-based development</td>  
  </tr>
  </table>

 4. The use of a .gitignore file within each project
 <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Project No</th>
    <th>Use of a .gitignore</th>        
     </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Password Credential Security</td>   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Password Credential Security</td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>The .gitignore file was not used for this project</td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>The .gitignore file was not used for this project</td>  
  </tr>
  </table>

 5. Storage of credentials and sensitive information<br>
 Storage of credential and sensitive information will not be stored in in github repositories. It will be stored in cloud for safety because all this project.
     I am going to make them public. Saving them in the cloud they will only be accessed only by authorized users.<br>
